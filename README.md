# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Restaurant-Reviews
The main objective of our project is to accurately extract peopleâ€™s opinions from a large number of unstructured review texts and classify them into either positive or negative review.
Thus, we have created a binary classification machine learning model(positive/negative) for customer reviews received by the restaurant.
Restaurants can see their overall performance by seeing number of positive and negative reviews and can improve them.
They can also make their customer support team to call back customers who gave negative reviews and resolve their issues.

# Colab Model
First we use the dataset that we have taken from Kaggle and apply Logistic Regression and we generate the pickle files and the model.

In the Dataset folder, there is a zip file. Download the zip file and extract the 2 csv files and add it to your drive.
The Historic.csv file contains the reviews of the restaurant from that we train the model and the FreshDump.csv contains the lastest restaurant reviews.
We test the accuracy of the model for the new reviews.
